# CodeLouisville Project

#### I originally planned to host this site at bryanwills.org. I really wanted to implement a dark mode switch for my entire site, but had difficulties in getting it to work the way I wanted it to and look the way I wanted it to. The code I used from a Codepen that someone else had done, had the label ID in the main element which caused complications for me elsewhere. I still have my original site layout hosted on bryanwills.org with the elements and divs outlined with a border color.

#### The homepage for bryanwills.dev is just a simple site that shows a random picture every time the page is loaded or refreshed. If a user selects text on this page, the text color and highlighted background changes color, just with some simple CSS variables.

#### The Cursor page is a simple html page that calls a Javascript file that transforms the cursor from a standard arrow into a circle with a 3em radius, and when hovered over the image, it actually displays the grayscale equivalent inside the circle. There are different filters that can be implemented, and my goal was to allow for more interaction for the user in the form of a drop-down menu to select 3-4 different changes like blurring for example and then the user can switch back and forth between the different options.

#### Prior to this class, I was working on hosting my own blog through my cloud server which points to bryanwills.dev and created a sub-domain blog.bryanwills.dev which is riding a 11ty framework using a .eleventy.js file to call the options I wish to configure, input and output folders while the posts are written in Markdown which is converted to HTML using the Nunjucks language for templates. This is a hobby of mine and I want to start a technical blog to maybe get a following behind me. Halfway through the Code Louisivlle session, I found out about Forem which is the platform for one of my favorite sites, dev.to that they use for their blogging platform. I didn't have enough time to complete before the deadline.

#### Projects

#### Family Page - I created this page shortly before taking the Code Louisville course. The idea was to use a CSS Masonry layout that is responsive for the user and changes the number of columns visible depending on the device being used. I decided to include this page as I am proud of my family and it shows the knowledge I had prior to taking this class.
