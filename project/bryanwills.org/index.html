          Hello! My name is Bryan Wills. I am an aspiring software developer who
          has spent 19 years in the IT industry. Up until now, I have been
          primarily working with computer hardware and computer networks. About
          4-5 years after starting in the IT industry, I started to develop an
          interest in software when a co-worker at the Network Operations Center
          I worked at, showed me this cool but 'older OS' called FreeBSD. Found
          an older computer running a Pentium 4 processor with HyperThreading
          (which at the time was BLAZING üî•), added a second NIC card to it,
          connected my modem to NIC 1, connected a 48-port Cisco 2950 Layer 3
          switch and made my own router, DHCP server, DNS server, wrote my own
          firewall rules through pf and I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I had a great job with the networking side of IT and I stuck
          with it and maintained a Network Engineer and Optical Network Engineer
          role for the next 5-6 years. If I could go back, I would have gone
          into software development. The possibilities in software development
          are amazing and at times, overwhelming. Python is the language I chose
          to delve into and hope to continue learning it along with other
          languages, frameworks and stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I can run my own ISP from home if I want to! I have my own home
          lab with a used Dell R420 with dual procs and 2 virtual disks that
          runs VMWare ESXi for all of my VMs and a Dell R520 with 12 x 3.5" bays
          that I am working on adding 4TB drives to each slot for my RAID5 array
          for a DIY NAS solution.
